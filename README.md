# About Me 
I'm a Software Engineer having about one year of experience as a Full Stack Web Developer and Machine Learning Engineer.

With 1 year of hands-on experience as a WordPress Developer and Machine Learning Engineer, I bring a unique skill set that combines front-end development with advanced data science techniques. My proficiency in WordPress development includes customizing themes, developing plugins, and optimizing website performance. On the machine learning side, I have experience in data preprocessing, model training, and deployment using Python and related frameworks. I am particularly interested in applying machine learning algorithms to improve user personalization, automate content management, and enhance website analytics. My approach is grounded in rigorous analysis and a commitment to delivering high-quality, scalable solutions.
