# About Me 
I'm a Software Engineer having about one year of experience as a MERN Stack Developer

Making Restful APIs with Node JS and MongoDB is one of my favorite tasks but I can also work on both (Front-end & back-end) sides by using the MERN stack.
I can Secure your Node JS App with authentication and authorization by using JSON Web Token and hashing your passwords.
If you are looking for a JavaScript (React JS or NODE JS) developer to get quality work then feel free to contact me.
Thanks.
